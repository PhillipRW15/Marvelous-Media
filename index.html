        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>Since the 3rd grade, I have been an avid reader that. Without any devices growing up, they were my primary
          source of entertainment and would transport me to fantastic words filled with magical beasts, courageous
          heroes and leave me with life lessons that have stuck with me even now. In the quiet moments spent with a
          book, I find refuge from the demands of the external world. Whether fiction or non-fiction, each book is a
          journey, an opportunity to broaden my horizons and deepen my understanding of the complexities of life. They
          inspire introspection, ignite my curiosity, and make me think outside my realm of thought.</p>

          only important what you do." - Patrick Ness</span>

        <h2>Movies</h2>
        <p>Movies have been an integral part of my life as they have shaped my interests, hobbies, childhood crushes and
          aspirations. My dad was a big movie watcher and so he would expose my siblings and I to a variety of genres
          growing up. From classics from the 70s and 80s to newly released films, I think movies as a whole have a lot
          to offer as they inspire new ideas and provide the viewer with information they might not otherwise know along
          with being a source of joy and entertainment. Being a college student, my taste in movies has evolved from
          what I enjoyed as a kid yet I still like to go back to the movies from my childhood as they give me a sense of
          nostalgia and happiness. </p>

          to do with the time that is given to us." - J.R.R Tolkien</span>

        <h2>TV</h2>
        <p>TV shows, to me, are an essential part of my leisure and cultural experience. They offer a unique form of
          storytelling that unfolds over multiple episodes, allowing for more in-depth character development and
          intricate plot arcs that can’t be portrayed in the span of a movie. Whether it’s a feelgood sitcom or a
          intense drama filled thriller, I use television as a way to destress after a long day and helps me think about
          new previously unknown concepts in an engaging way. </p>
