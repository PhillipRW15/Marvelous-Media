                            survived by
                            walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the
                            biggest
                            of Titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100
                            years
                            having a century of uneasy peace. But the walls of the city cannot hold forever.</p>
